        <h2>OKAY, BUT HOW DO I VOTE?</h2>
        <h3>As long as you’re over the age of 18, you’re legally allowed to vote. Your vote is your voice. It is the only way
            to ensure whoever you want representing you does represent you. From your councillors to the president. It is
            normal for us to focus only on the big one: Governorship and Presidential elections. But the others are also
            very important. It is the legislative who is saddled with making the laws. Your senators and your house of representatives
            members. They are the ones who represent your community. It is important you choose them wisely. And how else
            to choose but to vote? Whatever state you’re in, you can find a registration centre close to you. You go to the
            registration centre with a document that can prove your identity and your age. Your National Identity Card is
            fine, permanent or temporary. It hasn’t been decided when the registration will end, but it could be anytime.
